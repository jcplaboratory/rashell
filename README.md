# Rashell - Command Processor
Rashell is an Open-Source command processor for Windows.
It takes cues from the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) and from Bash Shell <code>bash</code>.

Rashell is developed by the community.

Introduction
--------------------------------------------

Rashell is developed using Microsoft .NET Framework.
Currently, .NET Framework 4.6 is required to run <code>Rashell</code>.

Recompiling using an older version of .NET should not be a problem.
<code>Rashell</code> is created to be fully dynamic and customizable.
Every behaviour of the Shell can be controlled from a configuration file <code>config.conf</code>. 
that is found in the startup directory of <code>Rashell</code>.


Licence

Comparison between 'Rashell' and 'cmd'
--------------------------------------------

* Rashell is fully configurable and user customizable.
* Rashell supports custom Environment Paths that aren't specifically registered on the machine through the <code>config.conf</code> file.
* Rashell is able to execute user defined executables.
* Rashell supports event and error loggin (We're still working on that one).
* Rashell is open-source.

Execution via Argument
--------------------------------------------
Rashell supports execution via argument.

Here is a list of the currently supported switches:

* `-c` This switch tells Rashell that it/she should execute the command specified. (Example: `rashell.exe -c mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).
* `-e` By default Rashell exits after the command parsed via arguments ends. To prevent that, use the switch `-e`. (Example: `rashell.exe -ce mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).
* `-v` By default Rashell doesn't display the command it executes that are parsed via arguments. To make it/she show the commands use the verbose (-v) switch. (`Example: rashell.exe -cev mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).

Built-in commands
--------------------------------------------

Rashell has number of buit-in commands.

Here's a list:

* `ls` - List all files and directories. Help command (`ls -?`).
* `mkdir` - Creates a new directory.
* `cd` - Sets the Current Working Directory.
* `pwd` - Prints the Current Working Directory.
* `echo` - Prints a string of characters on screen.
* `whoiam` - An enhanced version of `whoami`.
* `clear` - Clears the console's screen.
* `time` - Displays the current time.
* `date` - Displays the current date.
* `exit` & `bye` - Exits the Shell.

There's more to come.

Configuration overriders
----------------------------------------------

It is possible to override configuration parameters using the `--config$` option argument.

The current list of supported config overriders (non case-sensitive):

* `DEF_WORKING_DIR` changes the default directory in which Rashell starts up into.
  * Example: `rashell.exe --config$DEF_WORKING_DIR="%appdata%"` will cause Rashell to startup into the AppData Directory.
* `DISPLAY_WELCOME_MSG` can be used to toggle ON/OFF the display welcome message parameter.
  * Example: `rashell.exe --config$DISPLAY_WELCOME_MSG=OFF` toggles off Welcome Message.
*  `PRIORITIZE_BUILTIN_SHELL` can be used to toggle the built-in shell parameter.
  * Example: `rashell.exe --config$PRIORITIZE_BUILTIN_SHELL=OFF` will toggle off the parameter.
* `ENABLE_EVT_LOG` can be used to toggle ON/OFF Rashell's event-logger.
  * Example: `rashell.exe --config$ENABLE_EVT_LOG=ON` will turn on the event-logger.
* `ENABLE_ERR_LOG` can be used to toggle ON/OFF Rashell's error-logger.
  * Example: `rashell.exe --config$ENABLE_ERR_LOG=OFF` will turn off the error-logger.
  
Multiple overriders can be used at once alongside Rashell's switches and command.
